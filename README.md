# Text VAE for Sentence Embeddings

This repository explores a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** trained on sentence embeddings and studies the geometry of its latent space.

The project is organised into two main phases:

- **Phase 1 — Model Selection & Pareto Analysis**
- **Phase 2 — Latent Interpolation Geometry**

## Project Structure

This repository explores the geometry of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on sentence embeddings.
The work is organised into two experimental phases that use different datasets for different purposes.

### Phase 1 — Model Selection (AG News)

Phase 1 performs hyperparameter sweeps on the **AG News** dataset to study the trade-off between:

- reconstruction accuracy
- latent compression (KL divergence)

These experiments sweep the reconstruction–compression trade-off under a frozen encoder. The result is negative: an active-units check found 0 of 1860 latent units active across all 75 runs, so the frozen sweep is posterior-collapsed throughout.

**Correction:** a pooling bug in `eval.py` had folded 2 unfrozen runs from later work into the Pareto front. With the condition filter fixed, the corrected knee is `ld=4, β=0.1` at `kl_min=0.001` — the least-collapsed point in the grid, not a working VAE configuration. See `reports/00_phase1_pareto.md` for full detail.

### Phase 2 — Latent Geometry Analysis (STS-B)

Phase 2 probes the **geometry of the learned latent space** using sentence pairs from the **STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)** dataset.

STS-B provides interpretable sentence pairs that are well suited for **latent interpolation experiments**, allowing the trajectory between two sentences to be analysed in embedding space.

## Branch Structure

To keep the main codebase stable, experimental work for Phase 2 is maintained in a separate branch.

- **`main`**
Stable implementation and results for Phase 1 (AG News Pareto analysis).

- **`phase2-latent-interp`**
Experimental work exploring latent interpolation and geometry analysis using STS-B.

## Key Result

Latent interpolation produces **smooth semantic trajectories** while embedding interpolation remains nearly linear, indicating that the VAE decoder maps latent straight lines onto **curved embedding manifolds**.

## Disclaimer

This repository documents personal research exploring latent representations in Variational Autoencoders and their geometric properties in embedding spaces.

The work was undertaken as part of ongoing technical development in machine learning and AI assurance.
All experiments use publicly available datasets and open-source tools and are conducted independently of my employer.
